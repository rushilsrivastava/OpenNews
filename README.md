# OpenNews - A Chrome extension blocking Paywalls on News Sites
## Democracy dies behind paywalls.
### Get around the paywall for many news sites, and experience an open, free web.
A dead simple chrome extension that helps make navigating the web and Google News easier! This extension removes paywalls and other intruding things in your news browsing experience. 

I made this because as a student, it isn't practical for me to pay each company a tremendous amount of money yearly for their articles. The new PayWall concept just doesn't work for the average student. As always, pay if you can, because you are what keeps Journalism alive. 

## Installation
