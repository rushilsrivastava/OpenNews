### New Site Requests
Please open a new issue request and follow the template! Not all websites are doable since they may behind a hard paywall.

### Troubleshooting
* This extension works best alongside [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) and [uBlock Origin Extra](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin-extra/pgdnlhfefecpicbbihgmbmffkjpaplco).
* If a site doesn't work, try turning off uBlock and refreshing. If that doesn't work, try toggling the extension and manually checking for updates to ensure you are on the latest version of OpenNews. 
* If none of these work, you can submit an issue [here](https://github.com/rushilsrivastava/OpenNews/issues).
